I have a channel called TempehMusic, although it's not online. I like learning *how to code*, and how to **make stuff**.

I've made a concept of a programming language, called **dbs**. Here's a hello world example.
```dbs
!require base-dbs <- bdb

foundation main() {untilNewStructure}::
  prompt.displayText() {untilEnd("end:")}:
    return.up(1:) <( string<bdb> <- "Hello world!" );
  end:

space end() [end] {}:
```

### Thanks for checking me out!
